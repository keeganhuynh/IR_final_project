**Support request**
1. (27/01/2024) I don't know how to use the CIRR dataset to evaluate other similarity measures because I haven't read the dataset structure. If you have time on your hands, please check the dataset structure and provide an explanation for us.

2. Hiá»‡p is coding to evaluate using Recall in test1 


**Problem:**
1. The paper code relies on multi-threading for acceleration, but due to the original code being over 4 years old, there might be environmental conflicts. The code still runs, but after completion, it reports a multi-threading error.
2. I have corrected the file paths and some syntax in the old Python version that is not compatible with version 3.10.
3. I have set args.distributed to False by default (because I cannot perform computations on multiple GPUs)

**Read carefully GIT IGNORE and add folder DATA with exactly structure:**
